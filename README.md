## Problem Statement: 
Parents need a secure, controlled way to teach kids responsible spending in the digital world. Existing solutions often lack customization and proper oversight. KidPay addresses this by offering a secure wallet, parental controls, and a vault system for safe, approved spending.

## Whatâ€™s KidPay:
KidPay is a payment app that helps children learn responsible spending with complete parental control. Kids use a secure, easy-to-navigate wallet to make purchases only from pre-approved vendors across categories like education, PG-rated games, hobbies, and charitable giving. Parents curate a list of trusted merchants and must pre-approve each transaction, ensuring that kids are spending safely and responsibly.

## Technology Behind Kidpay:

**ERC-4326 Vault**: KidPay leverages a modified vault system inspired by ERC-4326, allowing parents to deposit ERC-20 tokens and mint yield-bearing tokens for their children. These tokens can only be spent at pre-approved merchants. The system uses a list of whitelisted addresses that can redeem the tokens for the original deposited ERC-20s.
